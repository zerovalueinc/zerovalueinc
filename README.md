## 🚀 From Tech Sales to Tech Builder

Once upon a time, I was the person demoing software, closing deals, and helping businesses find the right tech. I loved the energy, the people, and the thrill of solving tough problems—but something was missing. Every day, I found myself inspired by the incredible products I was selling. I thought, “What if I could build these things myself?”

So, I rolled up my sleeves, dove into code, and haven’t looked back since. Now I’m a builder—shipping apps, launching SaaS, and learning everything I can about tech from the inside out.

## 🛠️ What I'm Working On

- **Building & Shipping:** I’m obsessed with creating MVPs, tinkering with ideas, and getting real products in the hands of users.
- **Tech Stack:** Always exploring. Currently loving JavaScript (React, Node.js), but you’ll find me poking around in other stacks too.
- **Learning in Public:** I share my journey, my wins, and my faceplants—because every dev starts somewhere!

## ✨ Why I Love This Journey

Switching from tech sales to development wasn’t just a career move—it was an adventure. I bring the hustle from sales, the empathy for users, and a love for solving problems, right into my code. My goal? Build products that *actually* help people, and have a blast doing it.
